              <p>My name is Eliu Rosario. I was born in the Dominican Republic and i'm currently living in Miami, Florida.
      
              I'm a sports enthusiast who loves number, analytics and sabermetrics. As i got deeper into sabermetrics, a curiosity
              about all the programming behind this data made me want to switch fields, from business to computer science.  
                
              I'm an aspiring full stack delevoper. I have a new found passion for coding and designs. In this page you'll
              find some of the projects that i've worked on. My end goal is to provide creativity, quality design and 
              clean code.
      
              I hope you enjoy my portfolio!
